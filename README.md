# Welcome to Alexis Abner's MERN Stack Learning Journey! 👩‍💻

Hello, I'm Alexis Abner, an enthusiastic student on a learning journey in MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack development. I'm passionate about creating dynamic and modern web applications.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools I'm Exploring

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js: Building user interfaces with a focus on component-based architecture.
  - HTML/CSS: Crafting structured and styled web pages.
  - JavaScript: Enhancing interactivity and functionality.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js: Exploring server-side development with JavaScript.
  - Express.js: Building robust and scalable backend applications.
  - MongoDB: Diving into NoSQL databases for data storage.

- **Development Tools:**
  - Git: Tracking changes and collaborating on projects.
  - VSCode: My preferred code editor for development.

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

I'm currently deepening my understanding of:

- Building RESTful APIs with Express.js and Node.js.
- Integrating React.js with backend services.
- Working with MongoDB for database management.
- Deploying MERN stack applications.

## 💼 Projects I'm Working On

- [FilmAPI]: Developing the backend component for a "movies" web application, where users can access details about various movies, directors, and genres. The application enables user registration, allows them to modify personal information, and create a curated list of favorite movies.
